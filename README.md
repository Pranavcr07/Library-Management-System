# Library-Management-System
The library management system is project which is developed by using Python. The admin side does all the management like adding and managing categories, authors, books, issued books and the pricing of the books. Hence this can be a digital way of management of the library system. 

The project file contains a python script in 5 section and text file namely,
1)Main.py
      In the main section we are displaying the options which needs to be selected by the user. 
2)Borrow.py
      In this section we have written a script where the user needs to enter the name(first and last) of the borrower. Once after entering the name he can select the books which are present in the list. The borrower cannot take the same book twice.
3)Return.py
      In this section we have written a script where the borrower can return the books which he has borrowered from the library. After returning the book it shows the cost of the book which needs to be paid by the borrower. Here we have added an fuction where if the book return date is expried, then the penalty is added with the cost of book which he/she has borrowed. 
4)dt.py
      In this section we have written a script where it shows datas like on which date and time the borrower has borrowed the book.
5)ListSplit.py
      In this section we have written a scrpit where it takes all input persent in the text file(stock.txt) like name of the book, author, quantity and cost.
6)text file(stock.txt)
      In this section the user needs to input the data like name of the book, author, quantity and cost.
